Orbit and slingshot your way around the planets for as long as your limited fuel allows. Use arrow keys for thrust. Good Luck!

## Seeds and procedeural generation

If you get bored with the default level you can pass a seed to the game by adding it to the URL as a paramter like this `https://weird-gravity.netlify.app/?somehow_random`.
The seed allows you to share and compete in different levels.
